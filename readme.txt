This plugin Adds Site Authorization meta tags to your home page, to allow search engines to authoritate your ownership.


== Description ==

I read the other day on Google that if you buy a domain with a checkered past that has been punished by the search engines and you want it to be reincluded in the index... they said to VERIFY your site to get it re-indexed.  This plugin checks your meta tags to verify they are live, on-demand!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Do I need a Google Webmaster account and a Yahoo Site Explorer account?

No. It only outputs on the home page as per google and yahoos instruction.
